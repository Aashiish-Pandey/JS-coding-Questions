What are em and rem and why use them?
em is a CSS unit relative to the font size of the parent element, while rem is a CSS unit relative to the font size of an html element. Both of these are scalable units, meaning they give us the ability to scale elements up and down, relative to a set value. 
This adds more flexibility to our designs and makes our sites more responsive.
