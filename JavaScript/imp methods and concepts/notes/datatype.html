There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.


The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

Usually used as typeof x, but typeof(x) is also possible.
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript.
Number
BigInt
String
Boolean
null
undefined
Objects 
Symbols

We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable 
can at one moment be a string and then store a number:

// no error
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;
Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are
 called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there exist data types,
  but variables are not bound to any of them.
