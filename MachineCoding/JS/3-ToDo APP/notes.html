submit event :

The submit event fires when the user clicks a submit button or presses Enter while 
editing a field (e.g. <input type="text">) in a form.
 The event is not sent to the form when calling the form.submit() method directly.

We can set the window.contextmenu property to an event handler function to listen for right clicks on the page.

To do this, we write:

window.oncontextmenu = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  console.log('right clicked')
}
We have the e parameter that has the right-click event object.

We call e.preventDefault to stop the default behavior for right clicks, which is to show the context menu on the page.

Once we called that, we can do anything we want in the rest of the function when the user right-clicks on the page.
